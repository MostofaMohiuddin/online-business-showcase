We are one of the pioneering and respected Will Writing Companies based in the UK offering Wills and Lasting Powers of Attorney 
for those living in England and Wales,and for those living abroad but who have assets or property here in England or Wales.



We offer a tailored advice and we are a Web based virtual company. The Company is currently developing a Mobile App for Wills
called "Will-SMART" (TM Registration Pending) which can be downloaded from Apple Playstore or Android Playstore and it will guide 
you through a series of questions which will feed into our company's web server. A professional Will writer or solicitor shall
draft your will according to the instructions received. Or you can get in touch with us via email or on the telephone and place
your order with us for a new Will or LPA. If you have an existing Will, you may wish to update your Will because of Marriage or a 
birth of child or death of a relative or spouse or any other change of life circumstances that necessitates a change of your Will.

In England and Wales LPA's come in two flavours-
one deals with Health and Welfare, known as a Health and Welfare Lasting Power of Attorney.
The other type of Lasting Power of Attorney allows your named Attorneys to deal with your banking affairs and your property sales or
purcahse,known as a Financial and Property Affairs LPA. 

Both have registration fees costs as well our charges for carrying out the work on your behalf if instructed by you.

Kindly ring or email your details for further information .  Again the website has a Lasting Power of Attorney instruction questionnaire 
for you to completeif you are interested in beginning this process.
